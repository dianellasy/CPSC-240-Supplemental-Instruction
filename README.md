# CPSC-240 Supplemental Instruction Materials 
Hello Assembly Programmers! 👩🏻‍💻

Thank you so much for attending my SI session today!

This GitHub repository contains the main activity's source code. As you will notice, the code is not complete, as we will complete it as a group.  

I hope the completed code will guide you in completing the assignments. Let me know if you have any questions about the code during my session. 

Keep learning! Your hard work will pay off!

From, Dianella Sy, Your CPSC-240 Supplemental Instruction Leader ❤️
