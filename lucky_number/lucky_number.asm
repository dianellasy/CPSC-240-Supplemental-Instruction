; Output the invalid data detected message if the user inputted invalid data



; Ask for a floating-point number



; Obtain the floating-point number



; Calculate the floating-point number



; Check if the floating-point number the user inputted is a float



; If the floating-point number the user inputted is not a float, go back to tryAgain (the header/label) and input a floating-point number



; Convert the floating-point number the user inputted to a floating-point number



; Return the floating-point number to the driver



; Pop the General Purpose Registers (GPRs) so the pointer can be restored to the top of the stack and the values can be restored before this function was called
; After all the pops are done, the stack will be how it was before the function executed
